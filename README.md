# Pixelization
Pixelization is a process that decreases the resolution of an image or video with specific algorythms, thus achieving an image or video containing a smaller amount of pixels. The world of pixelart is a popular topic nowadays. Several image editing applications have built-in modules for creating pixelart from high quality images. In these editors algorithms range from the simplest to the more complex ones. In this project I engage in a special kind of pixelart: the – also more and more popular – Matrix, or more explicitly the transformation of buildings into giant displays. This means that the windows of the building become pixels or blocks of pixels. The task is to create a pixelanimation editor, and implement building-specific pixelart-converting
methods. I have written an application that accomplishes the conversion of images and videos, creating different pixelated shapes, importing and exporting files. It is also capable of creating animations and handling frames and layers. The important elements
of the application and their operating principles are described in this document.
